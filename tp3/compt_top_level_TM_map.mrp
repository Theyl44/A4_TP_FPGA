Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            7
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             4 out of       7   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       7    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           3 out of       7   42%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of 126,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1398 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <H> is placed at site <U9>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <H_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y0>. The clock IO can
   use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed
   on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in
   its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this
   problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable
   for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf
   file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to
   very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be
   corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock
   placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the
   .ucf file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "H" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:51 - The XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is not set.
INFO:Security:52 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'2100@172.18.0.18'.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc7a100t' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
