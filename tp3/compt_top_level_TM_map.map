.
ERROR:Place:1398 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <H> is placed at site <U9>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <H_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y0>. The clock IO can
   use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed
   on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in
   its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this
   problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable
   for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf
   file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to
   very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be
   corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock
   placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the
   .ucf file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "H" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
